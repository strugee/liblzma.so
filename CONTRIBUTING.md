I will take *any* suggestion for how to make this funnier. Especially places to redirect email.

The one exception to this is that I won't [verify my custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#securing-your-custom-domain) because I think that's even funnier.
